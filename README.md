# Vallet

Client and Admin app for Vallet platform

# Dev setup

For development we are using latest version of Android Studio 3.0.1 equipped
with Firebase (only crash reports for now).

To avoid additional overhead we are using product Flavors to distinguish between admin app and client app.
This way we will be able to speed up the development process by sharing at the beginning some code base.

For more details check build `productFlavors` in `app/build.gradle`

# Build
